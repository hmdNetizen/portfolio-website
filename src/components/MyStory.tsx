            My journey as a front-end developer started back in 2010, working as a{" "}
            <span className="text-primary">freelancer</span> for clients all over the world for several years.
          </p>
          <p>
            After being on my own for a while, I decided to enter the corporate world, and I started working as a software developer at{" "}
            <span className="text-primary">Webflow</span>, the same platform I was using with my freelance clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            After some exciting months of work at Webflow, I decided to transition to{" "}
            <span className="text-primary">Stripe</span>, where I returned what I love: front-end development.
          </p>
          <p>
            My success quickly compounded I started receiving job offers from the biggest names
            in the industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            All these opportunities led me to travel the world. Eventually, however, I decided to settle down for a more calm and simple routine, and I&apos;m now working at{" "}
            <span className="text-primary">Apple</span>. And you know what? I love what I do!
